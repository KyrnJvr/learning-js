Hello!

My name is Kyle, this repo is specifically for me to track my progress on learning the JavaScript programming language.

I have coded using JavaScript before, but I have never really taken the time to learn it in depth. So using this repo, I will be learning it from scratch.

The following resources are what I'm using to learn JavaScript:
1. Roadmap.sh https://roadmap.sh/javascript
2. FreeCodeCamp https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/full-javascript-course-for-beginners/
3. MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

I don't have a specific goal for each day learning the language, but I will be trying to learn something new every day.
